As far as I can remember it was the time of [Hacktoberfest-2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) hosted by [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/) when first time I had heard about Git & GitHub. We were supposed to create `Pull Requests` and they were monitoring who were creating their `PR` faster and top 10 were getting rewards. Not only by them even we can get official rewards like T-Shirt and cool stickers from Hacktoberfest for creating three Pull Requests. Well that's a preety fun way to start with Git,isn't it?

…do you really just want to contribute to your first open source project?

This one’s for you!

> It’s totally easy to get started with Git. If you’re a fast reader (and you don’t take a lot of time with sign up and installation), you can be up and running on GitHub about ten minutes from right now.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
