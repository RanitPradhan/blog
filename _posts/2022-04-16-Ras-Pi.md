Well... I'm a bit late to start with an interesting hardware like Rasberry Pi. But I'm very sure that I can able to explore it easily cause I have been a good time with Linux.

## What is Raspberry Pi?
- A low cost, credit-card sized computer.
- Can plug into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
- Capable of doing everything youâ€™d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

## Furthermore 
- The Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.

Hmm.. that's cool. Now,
## What all we need?
### Hardware
- A Raspberry Pi computer with an SD card or micro SD card
- A monitor with a cable (and, if needed, an HDMI adaptor)
- A USB keyboard and mouse
- A power supply
- Headphones or speakers (optional)
- An ethernet cable (optional)

### Software
- Raspberry Pi OS, installed using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

#### Installaton Procedure

  - <B> Install Rasperry Pi OS on your SD card with the Raspberry Pi Imager </B> <br>
  Go to the [website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and choose the OS you are using 
  or if you are a linux user just type 
  ```
  sudo apt install rpi-imager
  ``` 
  in your linux terminal. 
  - <B> Download and launch the Raspberry Pi Imager </B>
  - <B> Using the Raspberry Pi Imager </B>
    - First of all format the SD card you are going to use for R-Pi.
    - Insert your SD card into the computer or laptopâ€™s SD card slot.
    - In the Raspberry Pi Imager, select the OS that you want to install. The first option, Rasperry Pi O, is the recommended OS.
    - Select the SD card you would like to install it on. Different platforms will display the drives in different ways. Mac OS, for example, will show         you all drives including you main operating sysytem. 
    - <B>Note:</B> Make sure you are selecting the correct drive. The drives memory capacity can be a useful indication of which drive you are selecting.
    - Once you have selected both the OS and the SD card, a new `WRITE` button will appear. Simply click on it.
    - Wait for the Raspberry Pi Imager to finsh writing.
    - Once you get the following message, you can eject your SD card.
  - <B> Hello! Rasberrypi </B>
    You are going to take a first look at Raspberry Pi! You should have a Raspberry Pi computer in front of you for this. The computer shouldnâ€™t be           connected to anything yet.

To be continued.... xD ðŸ˜¬
