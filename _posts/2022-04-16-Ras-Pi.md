Well... I'm a bit late to start with an interesting hardware like Rasberry Pi. But I'm very sure that I can able to explore it easily cause I have been a good time with Linux.

## What is Raspberry Pi?
- A low cost, credit-card sized computer.
- Can plug into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
- Capable of doing everything youâ€™d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

## Furthermore 
- The Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.

Hmm.. that's cool. Now,
## What all we need?
### Hardware
- A Raspberry Pi computer with an SD card or micro SD card
- A monitor with a cable (and, if needed, an HDMI adaptor)
- A USB keyboard and mouse
- A power supply
- Headphones or speakers (optional)
- An ethernet cable (optional)

### Software
- Raspberry Pi OS, installed using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

#### Installaton Procedure

  - <B> Install Rasperry Pi OS on your SD card with the Raspberry Pi Imager </B> <br>
  Go to the [website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and choose the OS you are using 
  or if you are a linux user just type 
  ```
  sudo apt install rpi-imager
  ``` 
  in your linux terminal. 
  - <B> Download and launch the Raspberry Pi Imager </B>
