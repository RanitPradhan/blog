Well... I'm a bit late to start with an interesting hardware like Rasberry Pi. But I'm very sure that I can able to explore it easily cause I have been a good time with Linux.

## What is Raspberry Pi?
- A low cost, credit-card sized computer.
- Can plug into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
- Capable of doing everything youâ€™d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

## Furthermore 
- The Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.

To be continued.... xD ðŸ˜¬
